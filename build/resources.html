        <h3>How do I get on the neighborhood email list?</h3>
        <p>We are moving more of the non-critical HOA communications online, so the best way to keep up with what is going on in your community is to be on the neighborhood email list. You can be added by clicking the Contact button on this website and submitting your email address.</p>

        <h3>How do I get ___ fixed?</h3>
        <p>There are lots of different ways to fill in that blank, but there are two main avenues of providing service.</p>
        <p>If this issue is between the sidewalks (including streetlamps, trees that need pruning or the state of the sidewalks themselves) the county needs to be contacted. The simpliest way to do that is calling the Montgomery County hotline at 3-1-1 or visiting <a href="http://mc311.com">MC311.com</a></p>
        <p>If the issue is on HOA property, then contact the HOA Board by clicking the Contact button on this website and submitting your request.</p>
